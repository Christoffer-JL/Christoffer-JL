Hello, my name is Christoffer.
I am currently a 23 year old Swedish third and final year college student, attending LTH Helsingborg and studying Computer Science. During the two years leading up to my studies,
I worked as a laboratory assistant at Sk√•nemejerier, a dairy products manufactorer, where I maintained laboratory equipment, as well as performed quality- and safety tests on products. Currently, I am working at u-Blox with developing embedded systems.

I have programmed mostly in java, but have also coded in C, C#, HTML & CSS, Assembly and VHDL. My interests are, but are not limited to: back-end development, data communications and networking, and artificial intelligence.

Hello, my name is Christoffer.
I am currently a 23 year old Swedish second year college student, attending LTH Helsingborg and studying Computer Science. During the two years leading up to my studies,
I worked as a laboratory assistant at Sk√•nemejerier, a dairy products manufactorer, where I performed quality- and safety tests on products.

I have programmed mostly in java, but have also coded in C, C#, HTML & CSS, Assembly and VHDL. My interests are, but are not limited to: web programming, back-end development and User Interface design.
